# Linux-Commands
Knowledge in Linux from the module Linux Administration in second year. 
The module built on our knowledge from the previous module computer systems. Linux Administration was focused on Linux rather than
general knowledge about computers. 
I acquired the skills and knowledge to configure, manage and troubleshoot Linux Systems. 

In Detail I learned to: 
> Implement performance monitoring, task scheduling and logging capabilities in a Linux system.
> Administer and appraise essential system services at different runlevels.
> Develop sophisticated bash scripting capabilities to perform complex system administrative tasks.
> Build partitions for various Linux filesystems and employ associated administration tasks.
> Develop and configure a custom Linux kernel including essential services.
